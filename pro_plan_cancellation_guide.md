# Pro Plan Cancellation Guide

## Current Codebase Analysis

After analyzing your "alluneed-front" application, I found that **there is no pro plan or subscription management functionality currently implemented** in your codebase. The application includes:

### Current Features:
- Authentication system with role-based access (influencer, agency, marketer, admin)
- Account management page (`/myAccount`)
- Mock authentication for development
- User profile management

### Missing Features:
- No subscription/billing management
- No pro plan upgrade/downgrade options
- No payment processing integration
- No subscription cancellation functionality

## Where to Look for Pro Plan Cancellation

Since your current application doesn't have subscription management, you might be looking to cancel a pro plan from one of these common platforms:

### 1. **If this is a third-party service subscription:**
- Check your email for receipts from the service provider
- Look for billing information in your account settings
- Contact the service provider's customer support

### 2. **Common Pro Plan Cancellation Steps:**
1. **Login to your account** on the service provider's website
2. **Navigate to Account Settings** or **Billing/Subscription**
3. **Look for "Manage Subscription"** or **"Cancel Plan"**
4. **Follow the cancellation process** (usually requires confirmation)
5. **Save confirmation** of cancellation

### 3. **Platform-Specific Instructions:**

#### Apple Subscriptions:
1. Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions
2. Select the subscription → Cancel Subscription

#### Google Play:
1. Open Google Play Store → Account → Subscriptions
2. Select subscription → Cancel

#### Web-based Services:
1. Account Settings → Billing/Subscription
2. Cancel auto-renewal (usually need to cancel 24 hours before next billing)

## Implementing Pro Plan Management in Your App

If you want to add subscription management to your current application, you would need to:

### 1. **Backend Integration:**
```javascript
// Add to your API service
const subscriptionAPI = {
  getSubscription: () => api.get('/subscription'),
  cancelSubscription: () => api.post('/subscription/cancel'),
  updatePlan: (planId) => api.put('/subscription/plan', { planId })
};
```

### 2. **Frontend Components:**
- Subscription status component
- Plan management page
- Billing history
- Cancellation confirmation modal

### 3. **Database Schema:**
- User subscriptions table
- Plan types and pricing
- Billing history
- Cancellation records

### 4. **Payment Provider Integration:**
- Stripe, PayPal, or other payment processors
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- Recurring billing management

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Identify the specific service** you want to cancel
2. **Check your email** for subscription receipts
3. **Login to that service's website** and look for account/billing settings
4. **Contact customer support** if you can't find cancellation options
5. **Document the cancellation** for your records
